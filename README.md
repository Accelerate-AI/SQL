## Context Setting

SQL is one of the very important and foundational area to focus on to become a Data Analytics / Data Science Practitioner. Some suggestions / references are shared below.

Target Audience: Envision to get into roles of Data Analyst, Senior Data Analyst, Associate Data Scientist, Data Engineer etc. 

Suggested approach:
- Understand concepts in a step wise manner
- Practice regularly based on complexity
- Apply learning techniques to solve business questions
- SQL is just one of the dimension captured here

## SQL Concepts

SQL concepts are extremely important for any foundational data analysis work.

- Ability to write complex SQL statements to query the database and gain critical insight on data
- Ability to show comfort factor to medium to complex SQL statements, PL/SQL etc.
- Ability to understand advanced querying techniques

Fundamentals of SQL is very important for data analysis and it is core and fundamental to Data Science as well.
Some of the SQL areas that can be focused are as follows:
- The foundational components of all SQL queries
  - SELECT, FROM, WHERE etc
- Combine data sources while solving real life data problems
  - Joining data with the help of Joins (inner, left / right outer, full outer, cross)
  - UNION versus UNION ALL
- Analyze datasets and explore techniques to perform data analysis, derive more interesting insights
  - Correlated subqueries
  - Aggregations
  - “Where” versus “having”
- More aspects
  - Handling NULL values
  - Case statements, etc.
  - Filters
  - Groupings
  - Rankings
  - Verifying results and taking care of exceptions and NULL handling
- Organize your query for better readability
  - AS, WITH etc.

## Tools
- Presto: Presto is an open source distributed SQL query engine for running interactive analytic queries against data sources of all sizes ranging from gigabytes to petabytes. [Reference](https://prestodb.io/)
- Hive: The Apache Hive data warehouse software facilitates reading, writing, and managing large datasets residing in distributed storage using SQL. Structure can be projected onto data already in storage. A command line tool and JDBC driver are provided to connect users to Hive. [Reference](https://hive.apache.org/)
- Scalding: Scala DSL for cascading [Reference](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/enterprise-data-workflows/9781449359584/ch04.html)
